 We create a separate task for each event-market combination.
2. Each task fetches odds for a specific event and market.
3. We process the odds as soon as we have them, checking if all required bookmakers are available for that specific market.
4. If all required bookmakers are available for a market, we process it immediately, without waiting for other markets or events.
This method provides several advantages:
Maximum parallelism: We can process different markets for different events concurrently.
Faster results: We don't wait for all markets to be available before processing any of them.
Flexibility: If a certain market is not available for some events or bookmakers, it doesn't hold up the processing of other markets or events.
So, to directly answer your question: we're going with a third option, which is processing each event-market combination independently. This approach gives us the best balance of efficiency, speed, and flexibility in handling the data.
